maskable interrupt vs non maskable interrupt	

	A non-maskable interrupt is a hardware interrupt that cannot be disabled or ignored by the instructions of CPU.
	-often used when response time is critical or when an interrupt should never be disable during normal system operation. 
	Such uses include reporting non-recoverable hardware errors, system debugging and profiling and handling of species cases like system resets.

	Maskable interrupts help to handle lower priority tasks
	-The interrupts are either edge-triggered or level-triggered

To pass define to C from the compiler, use -DdefineVal

Using High speed external clock (HSE)

PLL phase locked loop 
	-It allows us to split the oscillator frequency and generate other frequencies with the same phase shift so that the output is consistent


Steps for setting up clock. See RCC registers in datasheet
1. Enable high speed external clock (HSE) and wait for it to be ready
2. Set the "power enable clock" and "voltage regulator"
3. Configure the flash related settings
	-enable Prefetch buffer. Prefetching refers to the retrieving and storing of data into the buffer memory (cache) before the processor requires the data.
	-flash latency = 5 clock cycles. 
Excluded
	-enable Instruction cache. Cache frequent instructions
	-enable data cache.
4. Configure rescalars for the clocks: main CLU clock (HCLK) and peripheral clocks (PCLK1 and PCLK2)
5. Configure the main phase-locked loop (PLL)
6. Select the Clock Source and wait for it to be set
