ST Link LED colour
	LED is blinking RED: 		the first USB enumeration with the PC is taking place. If it keeps blinking RED, maybe the USB driver is NOT found.
	LED is RED: 				communication between ST-LINK/V2 and the PC is established (end of enumeration).
	LED is blinking GREEN/RED: 	data are being exchanged between the target and the PC.
	LED is GREEN: 				the last communication has been successful.
	LED is ORANGE: 				ST-LINK/V2 communication with the target has failed.

maskable interrupt vs non maskable interrupt	

	A non-maskable interrupt is a hardware interrupt that cannot be disabled or ignored by the instructions of CPU.
	-often used when response time is critical or when an interrupt should never be disable during normal system operation. 
	Such uses include reporting non-recoverable hardware errors, system debugging and profiling and handling of species cases like system resets.

	Maskable interrupts help to handle lower priority tasks
	-The interrupts are either edge-triggered or level-triggered

To pass define to C from the compiler, use -DdefineVal

Using High speed external clock (HSE)

PLL phase locked loop 
	-It allows us to split the oscillator frequency and generate other frequencies with the same phase shift so that the output is consistent

There is an external oscillator on the ST link which allows the clock speed to reach 216 MHz


APB = Advanced High-performance Bus
HSE = High Speed External Clock
HCLK = Main CLU Clock 
PCLK = Peripheral Clocks 
PLL = Phase-Locked Loop
RCC = Reset and Control Clock
AHB = Advanced High-performance Bus
ARR = Auto Reload Register

PWM Notes
	- The TIMx_CCRx register can be updated at any time by software to control the output
		waveform, provided that the preload register is not enabled (OCxPE=’0’, else TIMx_CCRx
		shadow register is updated only at the next update event UEV)
	- OCx can be changed using CCxP bit in TIMx_CCER register. OCx output is enabled by a combination 
	of the CCxE, CCxNE, MOE, OSSI and OSSR bits (TIMx_CCER and TIMx_BDTR registers). 
	- In PWM mode 1 is when signal is high until overflow value is reached
	- There are 4 capture/control registers that can be triggered on the same timer
	- When a match is found between the capture/compare register and the counter, the output compare function:
		• Assigns the corresponding output pin to a programmable value defined by the output
		compare mode (OCxM bits in the TIMx_CCMRx register) and the output polarity (CCxP
		bit in the TIMx_CCER register). The output pin can keep its level (OCXM=0000), be set
		active (OCxM=0001), be set inactive (OCxM=0010) or can toggle (OCxM=0011) on
		match.
		• Sets a flag in the interrupt status register (CCxIF bit in the TIMx_SR register).
		• Generates an interrupt if the corresponding interrupt mask is set (CCXIE bit in the
		TIMx_DIER register).
		• Sends a DMA request if the corresponding enable bit is set (CCxDE bit in the
		TIMx_DIER register, CCDS bit in the TIMx_CR2 register for the DMA request
		selection).
	- Using a 16 bit counter
	- The PWM timer can reset when:
		• Counter overflow/underflow
		• Setting the UG bit
		• Update generation through the slave mode controller
	- Capture mode is input and Compare mode is output
