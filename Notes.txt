maskable interrupt vs non maskable interrupt	

	A non-maskable interrupt is a hardware interrupt that cannot be disabled or ignored by the instructions of CPU.
	-often used when response time is critical or when an interrupt should never be disable during normal system operation. 
	Such uses include reporting non-recoverable hardware errors, system debugging and profiling and handling of species cases like system resets.

	Maskable interrupts help to handle lower priority tasks
	-The interrupts are either edge-triggered or level-triggered

To pass define to C from the compiler, use -DdefineVal

Using High speed external clock (HSE)

PLL phase locked loop 
	-It allows us to split the oscillator frequency and generate other frequencies with the same phase shift so that the output is consistent

There is an external oscillator on the ST link which allows the clock speed to reach 216 MHz
